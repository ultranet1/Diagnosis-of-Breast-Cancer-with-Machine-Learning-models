# Diagnosis-of-Breast-Cancer-with-Machine-Learning-models
This project is like a tradition for upcoming data scientists. It's about Cancer of the breast diagnosis by checking for the correlations in Breast measurements like Area, Perimeter, radius, concave point etc. 
The dataset is from kaggle(breast cancer wilsconsi)

It's a classification problem,so I used models like Logistic regression, SVM, Random forest and K nearest neighbor. I used sklearn library for this...

For the EDA part, I used pandas,which shows 50-60% of diagnosis is benign. Also the diagnosis have strong correlation with radius,area, perimeter, concavity and concave point.

The most accurate model is Random forest with accuracy of 96%>

What's the application?
I think this Model can be used in computer vision to diagnose breast cancer in women. Thank you
