# Diagnosis-of-Breast-Cancer-with-Machine-Learning-models
This project is like a tradition for data scientists. It's about Cancer of the breast diagnosis by checking for the correlations in Breast measurements like Area, Perimeter, radius, concave point etc. 
The dataset is from kaggle(breast cancer wilsconsi)

It's a classification problem,so I used models like Logistic regression, SVM, Random forest and K nearest neighbor. I used sklearn library for this...

For the EDA part, I used pandas,which shows 50-60% of diagnosis is benign. Also the diagnosis have strong correlation with radius,area, perimeter, concavity and concave point.

The accuracy and confusion matrix is used to evaluate the models.

What's the application?
I think this Model can be used in computer vision to diagnose breast cancer in women.


The web app was built in Python using the following libraries:

streamlit
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
pickle
